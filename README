HigherExplosives
================

A very simple plugin to control the destructive potential of explosions in Minecraft, for use with the Craftbukkit and Bukkit modding system.
In its default configuration it doubles the size of TNT explosions. TNT, creepers, and fireballs can all have their size and yield (percentage of destoyed items dropped) tweaked.
These tweaks can be selectively applied to several different worlds.

Versions
--------

HigherExplosives v1.3.1 was tested with a CraftBukkit server version 456 (http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/456/artifact/target/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) and a Minecraft 1.3_01 client.

It was coded against Bukkit version 417 (http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-Bukkit/org.bukkit$bukkit/417/artifact/org.bukkit/bukkit/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/bukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).

Installation
------------

Installation is a simple matter of placing the HigherExplosives.jar file into your CRAFTBUKKIT/plugins directory. No configuration is necessary to give it a test, but a default configuration will automatically be created as CRAFTBUKKIT/plugins/HigherExplosives/config.yml

Configuration
-------------

This default configuration is:

everyExplosion:
    yield: 0.3
entities:
    Creeper:
        radiusMultiplier: 1.0
        fire: false
    TNTPrimed:
        radiusMultiplier: 2.0
        fire: false
    Fireball:
        radiusMultiplier: 1.0
        fire: false
version: '1.3.1'


- The everyExplosion.yield option dictates what percentage of blocks destroyed in an explosion will drop an item. It is a value between 0.0 (no blocks) and 1.0 (every single block). This value applies to explosions coming from any entity. The Minecraft default is 0.3 (30%).

- There are three different entities that create explosions (tell me if this is wrong): TNTPrimed, a Fireball (Ghasts), and a Creeper. Each of these are individually configured.

- The radiusMultiplier is pretty obvious. 1.0 will use the original blast radius. 0.5 gives half size explosions, whilst 2.0 blasts will be twice as big as normal. After igniting TNT by hand, you can run away in time when it's set to a multiplier of 2, but with a multiplier of 3 there's not enough time to run away!

- The fire property is included for completeness. I didn't see any difference when I tested it myself, but it probably flags whether the explosion causes fire or not.

- The version property is mandatory but it just lets the plugin show a warning if the configuration version is different to the plugin version. If it's missing, the configuration is considered to be missing and the default configuration will be written to the file probably overwriting anything that might be there.


To help check and/or diagnose what the plugin thinks the configuration is, use the "debugConfig: true" property. It defaults to false if not specified.


Multi world configuration
-------------------------

The configuration above is the default for all worlds.

It's possible to make specific worlds behave differently. e.g. a configuration like..

worlds:
    netherworld:
        everyExplosion:
            yield: 0.0
        entities:
            TNTPrimed:
                radiusMultiplier: 0.25

..would render TNT fairly impotent in the world called "netherworld".
If the other entities are not given a configuration for this world, then they will take on the default configuration for all worlds. Likewise for the activebounds property.
The same is true for explosion yields (and yield bounds) if the "everyExplosion" property is not given for the specific world.

Just to be sure, add the "debugConfig: true" property to see what the plugin will be using.

You can add as many specific worlds as you like. e.g.:

worlds:
    netherworld:
        blah blah..
    nuclearCreeper:
        entities:
            Creeper:
                radiusMultiplier: 2.0
    survivalIsland:
        entities:
            Creeper:
                radiusMultiplier: 1.0
                fire: true
            TNTPrimed:
                radiusMultiplier: 0.0
debugConfig: true


Optional bounds configuration
-----------------------------

There is an optional configuration property (called "activeBounds") for restricting the explosion modifications to those whose epicentre's lie within some configured bounds..
For example, the following will only let the TNTPrimed explosions be modified when the epicentre's Y coordinate is below 10 (i.e. explosions only modified if the TNT block's altitude is below 10):

    TNTPrimed:
        activeBounds:
            max:
                y: 10


More restrictive bounding boxes can be specified. For example, the following will neutralize creepers within some protected 20x20x20 cuboid zone:

    Creeper:
        radiusMultiplier: 0.0
        activeBounds:
            max:
                x: 10
                y: 10
                z: 10
            min:
                x: -10
                y: -10
                z: -10

Any of the bounds may be left off to relax the restrictions.

If an entity has no activeBounds property then the explosion modifications will always be applied no matter where it happens.


Unfortunately in the current version, the yield modifications of explosions is applied to every single explosion regardless of whether it's within its activeBounds or not.
Some coarse grained control can be had over this by applying some general bounds in which explosions (of any and all types) will have their yield modified.
For example, the following configuration fragment will make all explosions below an altitude of 10 yield no objects (perhaps useful to avoid nuclear sized underground explosions from hurting the server with too many items?). Any explosion above this altitude will not have its yield modified:

everyExplosion:
    yield: 0.0
    yieldChangeActiveBounds:
        max:
            y: 10
